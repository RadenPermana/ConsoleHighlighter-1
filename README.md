Console Highlighter is tool that leverages Alex Gorbatchev's Syntax Highlighter tool to highlight all his supported syntax highlighting. Rather than perform that syntax highlighting on the web, however, it uses ANSI escape sequences to highlight supplied source code in the console.

It also has node.js bindings such that this functionality can be used in other node based applications with ease.
